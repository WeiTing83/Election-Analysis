# Election-Analysis

## Overview of Election Audit: 
Tom and Seth will use Python to analyze the election result. It can accelerate analysis process and obtain the result instantly. Without using Python, they would spend more time on the process and even might have typos to cause further delay. Therefore, they want to build up the scrip to enable automatic data analysis process.

## Election-Audit Results: 
   1. There are 369711 votes casted from the three counties, Jefferson, Denver and Arapahoe.

## Election-Audit Summary
By applying the developed script, we are able to automatically analyze the election data and get the outcome efficiently and clearly. Moreover, this script can be further modified for most of elections. First of all, we can introduce population that meet eligibility requirements for voting and finish voter registration into the script to see if the winner obtain specific percentage of vote from the population. In some elections, candidates need to receive certain percentage of vote from the population to win the election. Secondly, we also can introduce rate of null vote into the script to see how the voters respond to the candidates in the poll. Sometimes, the candidates may not satisfy votersâ€™ expectation. So, some of voters may give null votes to express their disagreement. Therefore, putting percentage of null vote would help election committee to justify the election legislation.
